### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Leo Zhi from Shanghai China.
I am now a member of class of 2029 in Cornell University majoring in CS, currently working towards SWE, SDE, or MLE.
LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/zhu-zhi-506499376/
I used to be a FRC programmer, creating some fancy but suspicious codes( but you can not tell what's wrong with these codes)
To reach me: I am thinking about how I would like to contact with you! Contact ways coming soon!
