# Hi, I'm Zhu Zhi, and I go by Leo 👋

I’m a Computer Science undergraduate at **Cornell University** who enjoys building systems that actually work in the real world — not just models that look good in a notebook.

My interests sit at the intersection of:

- **AI Agents & LLM Systems**
- **Backend & Distributed Systems**
- **Robotics & Control Software**
- **Reliable, explainable engineering**

I care a lot about robustness.  
Not just *can it run*, but *can users trust it*.

## 🔧 What I Build

### 🤖 Agentic AI Systems
I design LLM systems as **software systems**, not prompts.

I work on:
- Tool-augmented reasoning
- RAG pipelines
- Multi-agent orchestration (LangGraph)
- Streaming workflows & long-running tasks
- Reliability & observability of AI outputs

Example work:
- Financial analysis agents with reproducible sandbox execution
- Traceable reasoning pipelines
- Retrieval-grounded answer generation
- Cost and behavior monitoring for LLM workflows

I’m especially interested in turning AI from a **black box** into a **verifiable process**.

### 🧠 Backend & Infrastructure
I enjoy designing architectures more than writing isolated features.

Technologies I commonly use:
- **Java / Spring Boot**
- **Node.js / Express**
- **Go services**
- **SQL & NoSQL databases**
- **Docker + Cloud deployment (AWS/GCP)**

Typical problems I like solving:
- system reliability
- data consistency
- authentication design (JWT/session)
- API design & scalability
- async workflows

---

### 🌊 Robotics & Control Software
I’m a software engineer on the **Cornell Autonomous Underwater Vehicle team**.

I work on:
- asynchronous control systems
- real-world sensor data pipelines
- parameter estimation via ML
- control tuning & stability

Recently I built a data-driven model that reduced control error by **~80%** using real-world test data.

I like robotics because physics does not accept excuses.

## 🧩 How I Think About Engineering

Good engineering is about **tradeoffs**, not perfect solutions.

I value:
- clarity over cleverness
- observability over magic
- iteration over over-design
- user needs over technical ego

My goal is to build systems where:
> The user understands *why* the system produced the answer — not just what the answer is.
