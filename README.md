# Hi, I'm Zhu Zhi, and I go by Leo 👋

I’m a Computer Science undergraduate at **Cornell University** who enjoys building systems that actually work in the real world — not just models that look good in a notebook.

My interests sit at the intersection of:

- **AI Agents & LLM Systems**
- **Backend & Distributed Systems**
- **Robotics & Control Software**
- **Reliable, explainable engineering**

I care a lot about robustness.  
Not just *can it run*, but *can users trust it*.

## 🧩 How I Think About Engineering

Good engineering is about **tradeoffs**, not perfect solutions.

I value:
- clarity over cleverness
- observability over magic
- iteration over over-design
- user needs over technical ego
- communication + teamwork over working alone

My goal is to build systems where:
> The user understands *why* the system produced the answer — not just what the answer is.
